## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Inline-block elements' margins don't collapse.[^1]

---

Line breaks can be made responsive by "styling" the `<br />` element.

### Useful resources

- [^1]: [CSS Spec - Box Model - Collapsing Margins](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins)
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
