## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass, BEM
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Leaflet.js] (https://leafletjs.com/) and [Geoapify] (https://www.geoapify.com/)

### What I learned

Inline-block elements' margins don't collapse.

---

Line breaks can be made responsive by "styling" the `<br />` element.

---

Making the interactive was a great practice for interacting with API's and I learned a lot about how they work.
